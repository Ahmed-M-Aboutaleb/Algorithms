# Divide And Conquer

## What is Divide and Conquer?

Divide and Conquer is an algorithmic paradigm. A typical Divide and Conquer algorithm solves a problem using the following three steps:

1. **Divide**: Break the given problem into subproblems of same type.
2. **Conquer**: Recursively solve these subproblems
3. **Combine**: Appropriately combine the answers

## Why Divide and Conquer?

The Divide and Conquer paradigm is useful when a problem can be broken down into similar sub-problems. In this paradigm, we recursively break the problem into two or more sub-problems of the same or related type, until these become simple enough to be solved directly. The solutions to the sub-problems are then combined to give a solution to the original problem.
